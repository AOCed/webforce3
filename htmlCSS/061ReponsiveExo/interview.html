						<h3>As the editor of magazine</h3>
						<p> CYS: I heard that it was the first time someone released a magazine as obscene as yours in South Korea. What brought you to the erotic magazine as a art-school student?

DR: Sexuality is always in the heart of my works. At first, it came from my personal experience living as a woman in South Korea. I felt guilty when I thought of sexual things, and I have spent my girlhood like that. It provoked me in some way and made me want to play with taboos. I was interested in power of others’ eyes, which led me to the idea of Zuzn Magazine.

CYS: You might have some stories when making the magazine on erotism.

DR: It is possible that my magazine has got more attention because of the fact that it is made by a young woman. I met a lot of interesting people as well as annoying people.

One time, I was discussing with a guy who listened to me with attention. I told him that I would prefer something more pornographic than artistic. He proposed me to watch some porno when we were two of us together. (Laugh)

Another guy approached me to buy the magazine and asked me several times to meet each other. I told him I didn’t want to meet out of context. He insulted me after… Because I posed nude, they thought I was “easy”, and never imagined that I can refuse them. Through those incidents I see how people judge with what I do.

CYS: what is your further plan or direction for the magazine?

DR: I knew porno early in my life and wrote erotic fictions in public W.C. I was attracted by porno but also felt very uncomfortable. I wanted something erotic for women. I always think that lesbian porno is not for lesbians but for hetero men. I don’t say that my magazine is for women, but that is definitely something I enjoy as a woman. Zuzn will talk about not only sex itself but more different sexual tastes, lust and taboos. </p>

					<h3>As a gourmand</h3>
					<p>
						 

CYS: Tell me a bit if you have any memorable culinary landscapes or dishes in your life. 

DR: My dad has interfered in my appearance. He scolded me when I ate much because I would get fat. I always had to pay attention to his remarks. Now sometimes I just eat to show I’m eating this much. (laugh)

My grandma was a good cook. I always think of her oxtail soup. During summer vacations, I’ve stayed in her house. She cooked me every day something delicious and one day, she asked me if a toast would be fine for me because she didn’t feel good and she felt sorry for that.  I was wondering why she felt sorry while I would love so much a toast. She made ma instant ramen for the first time that day. 

My dad didn’t agree with me leaving for France for the study. But I was more stubborn than him so I decided to leave in spite of his disagreement.  A couple of days before leaving, as he knows well that I love sashimi, he brought me freshly treated croaker sashimi from Yeonan harbor. 

CYS: Your most exciting cooking ingredients?

DR: Seafood, oyster sauce, onion, garlic, avocado, soy sauce and vinegar

CYS: If you create a new recipe by yourself, what would be?

DR: Kimchi fry with cheese and with sweet and sour sauce like Tangsuyuk.  Maybe someone already made it?
